## Unreleased

### Breaking

- Change return value of `prelude::RepositoryAccessExt::committer()` from `git_actor::Signature` to `Result<git_actor::Signature, easy::borrow:repo::Error>`
- Change return value of `prelude::ReferenceAccessExt` from `Result<Vec<RefEdit>>, _>` to `Result<easy::Reference, _>`.
- Rename `State` structs that serve as platform for iterators or other dependent types into `Platform`. These are usually intermediate objects only.
- Rename `easy::Reference::log()` into `easy::Reference::logs()`
