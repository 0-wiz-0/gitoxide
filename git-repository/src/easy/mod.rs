//! ### Which `Easy*` is for me?
//!
//! * Use `Easy*Exclusive` when the underlying `Repository` eventually needs mutation, for instance to update data structures
//!    - This is useful for long-running applications that eventually need to adapt to changes in the repository and pick up
//!      new packs after a GC operation or a received pack.
//! * Use the non-exclusive variants if the `Repository` doesn't ever have to change, for example as in one-off commands.
//!
//! ### Implementation Notes
//!
//! - Why no `Easy` with simply an owned `Repository`, instead `Rc<Repository>` is enforced
//!    - When this is desired, rather use `EasyShared` and drop the `EasyShared` once mutable access to the `Repository` is needed.
//!      `Access` is not usable for functions that require official `&mut` mutability, it's made for interior mutability to support
//!       trees of objects.
