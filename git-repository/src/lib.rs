//! This crate provides the [`Repository`] abstraction which serves as a hub into all the functionality of git.
//!
//! It's powerful and won't sacrifice performance while still increasing convenience compared to using the sub-crates
//! individually. Sometimes it may hide complexity under the assumption that the performance difference doesn't matter
//! for all but the fewest tools out there, which would be using the underlying crates directly or file an issue.
//!
//! # The prelude and extensions
//!
//! With `use git_repository::prelude::*` you should be ready to go as it pulls in various extension traits to make functionality
//! available on objects that may use it.
//!
//! The method signatures are still complex and may require various arguments for configuration and cache control.
//!
//! ## Easy-Mode
//!
//! Most extensions to existing objects provide an `obj_with_extension.easy(&repo).an_easier_version_of_a_method()` or `easy(&repo)`
//! method to hide all complex arguments and sacrifice some performance for a lot of convenience.
//!
//! When starting out, use `easy(â€¦)` and migrate to the more detailed method signatures to squeeze out more performance.
//!
//! ### Design Sketch
//!
//! Goal is to make the lower-level plumbing available without having to deal with any caches or buffers, and avoid any allocation
//! beyond sizing the buffer to fit the biggest object seen so far.
//!
//! * no implicit object lookups, thus `Oid` needs to get an `Object` first to start out with data
//! * Objects with `Ref` suffix can only exist one at a time unless they are transformed into an owned version of it OR
//!   multiple `Easy` handles are present, each providing another 'slot' for an object as long as its retrieved through
//!   the respective `Easy` object.
//! * `ObjectRef` blocks the current buffer, hence many operations that use the buffer are consuming
//! * There can only be one `Object` at a time, but as many `Oids` as you want.
//! * Anything attached to `Access` can be detached to lift the object limit or make them `Send` able. They can be `attached` to another
//!   `Access` if needed.
//! * git-repository functions return `Oid` for oids if they originate in something having or being `Access`
//!
//! #### Limitations
//!
//! * types containing `&impl Access` can't access extension traits directly but have to use a workaround. This is due to the way
//!   extension traits can't apply internally if if it is implemented, but must be part of the external interface
//!
//! # Cargo-features
//!
//! ## One-stop-shop
//!
//! To make using  _sub-crates_ easier these are re-exported into the root of this crate.
//!
