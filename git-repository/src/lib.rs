//! This crate provides the [`Repository`] abstraction which serves as a hub into all the functionality of git.
//!
//! It's powerful and won't sacrifice performance while still increasing convenience compared to using the sub-crates
//! individually. Sometimes it may hide complexity under the assumption that the performance difference doesn't matter
//! for all but the fewest tools out there, which would be using the underlying crates directly or file an issue.
//!
//! # The prelude and extensions
//!
//! With `use git_repository::prelude::*` you should be ready to go as it pulls in various extension traits to make functionality
//! available on objects that may use it.
//!
//! The method signatures are still complex and may require various arguments for configuration and cache control.
//!
//! ## Easy-Mode
//!
//! Most extensions to existing objects provide an `obj_with_extension.easy(&repo).an_easier_version_of_a_method()` or `easy(&repo)`
//! method to hide all complex arguments and sacrifice some performance for a lot of convenience.
//!
//! When starting out, use `easy(â€¦)` and migrate to the more detailed method signatures to squeeze out more performance.
//!
//! # Cargo-features
//!
//! ## One-stop-shop
//!
//! To make using  _sub-crates_ easier these are re-exported into the root of this crate.
