## 0.1.0 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.0.0 (2022-03-17)

An empty crate without any content to reserve the name for the gitoxide project.
