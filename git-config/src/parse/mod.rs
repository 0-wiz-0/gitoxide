//! This module handles parsing a `git-config` file. Generally speaking, you
//! want to use a higher abstraction such as [`File`] unless you have some
//! explicit reason to work with events instead.
//!
//! The general workflow for interacting with this is to use one of the
//! `parse_from_*` function variants. These will return a [`State`] on success,
//! which can be converted into an [`Event`] iterator. The [`State`] also has
//! additional methods for accessing leading comments or events by section.

/// A zero-copy `git-config` file parser.
///
/// This is parser exposes low-level syntactic events from a `git-config` file.
/// Generally speaking, you'll want to use [`File`] as it wraps
/// around the parser to provide a higher-level abstraction to a `git-config`
/// file, including querying, modifying, and updating values.
///
/// This parser guarantees that the events emitted are sufficient to
/// reconstruct a `git-config` file identical to the source `git-config`.
///
/// # Differences between a `.ini` parser
///
/// While the `git-config` format closely resembles the [`.ini` file format],
/// there are subtle differences that make them incompatible. For one, the file
/// format is not well defined, and there exists no formal specification to
/// adhere to. Thus, attempting to use an `.ini` parser on a `git-config` file
/// may successfully parse invalid configuration files.
///
/// For concrete examples, some notable differences are:
/// - `git-config` sections permit subsections via either a quoted string
/// (`[some-section "subsection"]`) or via the deprecated dot notation
/// (`[some-section.subsection]`). Successful parsing these section names is not
/// well defined in typical `.ini` parsers. This parser will handle these cases
/// perfectly.
/// - Comment markers are not strictly defined either. This parser will always
/// and only handle a semicolon or octothorpe (also known as a hash or number
/// sign).
/// - Global properties may be allowed in `.ini` parsers, but is strictly
/// disallowed by this parser.
/// - Only `\t`, `\n`, `\b` `\\` are valid escape characters.
/// - Quoted and semi-quoted values will be parsed (but quotes will be included
/// in event outputs). An example of a semi-quoted value is `5"hello world"`,
/// which should be interpreted as `5hello world`.
/// - Line continuations via a `\` character is supported.
/// - Whitespace handling similarly follows the `git-config` specification as
/// closely as possible, where excess whitespace after a non-quoted value are
/// trimmed, and line continuations onto a new line with excess spaces are kept.
/// - Only equal signs (optionally padded by spaces) are valid name/value
/// delimiters.
///
/// Note that that things such as case-sensitivity or duplicate sections are
/// _not_ handled. This parser is a low level _syntactic_ interpreter (as a
/// parser should be), and higher level wrappers around this parser (which may
/// or may not be zero-copy) should handle _semantic_ values. This also means
/// that string-like values are not interpreted. For example, `hello"world"`
/// would be read at a high level as `helloworld` but this parser will return
/// the former instead, with the extra quotes. This is because it is not the
/// responsibility of the parser to interpret these values, and doing so would
/// necessarily require a copy, which this parser avoids.
///
/// # Trait Implementations
///
/// - This struct does _not_ implement [`FromStr`] due to lifetime
/// constraints implied on the required `from_str` method. Instead, it provides
/// [`From<&'_ str>`].
///
/// # Idioms
///
/// If you do want to use this parser, there are some idioms that may help you
/// with interpreting sequences of events.
///
/// ## `Value` events do not immediately follow `Key` events
///
/// Consider the following `git-config` example:
///
/// ```text
/// [core]
///   autocrlf = input
/// ```
///
/// Because this parser guarantees perfect reconstruction, there are many
/// non-significant events that occur in addition to the ones you may expect:
///
/// ```
/// # use git_config::parse::{Event, State, section};
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// # let section_header = section::Header {
/// #   name: section::Name(Cow::Borrowed("core".into())),
/// #   separator: None,
/// #   subsection_name: None,
/// # };
/// # let section_data = "[core]\n  autocrlf = input";
/// # assert_eq!(State::from_str(section_data).unwrap().into_vec(), vec![
/// Event::SectionHeader(section_header),
/// Event::Newline(Cow::Borrowed("\n".into())),
/// Event::Whitespace(Cow::Borrowed("  ".into())),
/// Event::SectionKey(section::Key(Cow::Borrowed("autocrlf".into()))),
/// Event::Whitespace(Cow::Borrowed(" ".into())),
/// Event::KeyValueSeparator,
/// Event::Whitespace(Cow::Borrowed(" ".into())),
/// Event::Value(Cow::Borrowed("input".into())),
/// # ]);
/// ```
///
/// Note the two whitespace events between the key and value pair! Those two
/// events actually refer to the whitespace between the name and value and the
/// equal sign. So if the config instead had `autocrlf=input`, those whitespace
/// events would no longer be present.
///
/// ## `KeyValueSeparator` event is not guaranteed to emit
///
/// Consider the following `git-config` example:
///
/// ```text
/// [core]
///   autocrlf
/// ```
///
/// This is a valid config with a `autocrlf` key having an implicit `true`
/// value. This means that there is not a `=` separating the key and value,
/// which means that the corresponding event won't appear either:
///
/// ```
/// # use git_config::parse::{Event, State, section};
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// # let section_header = section::Header {
/// #   name: section::Name(Cow::Borrowed("core".into())),
/// #   separator: None,
/// #   subsection_name: None,
/// # };
/// # let section_data = "[core]\n  autocrlf";
/// # assert_eq!(State::from_str(section_data).unwrap().into_vec(), vec![
/// Event::SectionHeader(section_header),
/// Event::Newline(Cow::Borrowed("\n".into())),
/// Event::Whitespace(Cow::Borrowed("  ".into())),
/// Event::SectionKey(section::Key(Cow::Borrowed("autocrlf".into()))),
/// Event::Value(Cow::Borrowed("".into())),
/// # ]);
/// ```
///
/// ## Quoted values are not unquoted
///
/// Consider the following `git-config` example:
///
/// ```text
/// [core]
/// autocrlf=true""
/// filemode=fa"lse"
/// ```
///
/// Both these events, when fully processed, should normally be `true` and
/// `false`. However, because this parser is zero-copy, we cannot process
/// partially quoted values, such as the `false` example. As a result, to
/// maintain consistency, the parser will just take all values as literals. The
/// relevant event stream emitted is thus emitted as:
///
/// ```
/// # use git_config::parse::{Event, State, section};
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// # let section_header = section::Header {
/// #   name: section::Name(Cow::Borrowed("core".into())),
/// #   separator: None,
/// #   subsection_name: None,
/// # };
/// # let section_data = "[core]\nautocrlf=true\"\"\nfilemode=fa\"lse\"";
/// # assert_eq!(State::from_str(section_data).unwrap().into_vec(), vec![
/// Event::SectionHeader(section_header),
/// Event::Newline(Cow::Borrowed("\n".into())),
/// Event::SectionKey(section::Key(Cow::Borrowed("autocrlf".into()))),
/// Event::KeyValueSeparator,
/// Event::Value(Cow::Borrowed(r#"true"""#.into())),
/// Event::Newline(Cow::Borrowed("\n".into())),
/// Event::SectionKey(section::Key(Cow::Borrowed("filemode".into()))),
/// Event::KeyValueSeparator,
/// Event::Value(Cow::Borrowed(r#"fa"lse""#.into())),
/// # ]);
/// ```
///
/// ## Whitespace after line continuations are part of the value
///
/// Consider the following `git-config` example:
///
/// ```text
/// [some-section]
/// file=a\
///     c
/// ```
///
/// Because how `git-config` treats continuations, the whitespace preceding `c`
/// are in fact part of the value of `file`. The fully interpreted key/value
/// pair is actually `file=a    c`. As a result, the parser will provide this
/// split value accordingly:
///
/// ```
/// # use git_config::parse::{Event, State, section};
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// # let section_header = section::Header {
/// #   name: section::Name(Cow::Borrowed("some-section".into())),
/// #   separator: None,
/// #   subsection_name: None,
/// # };
/// # let section_data = "[some-section]\nfile=a\\\n    c";
/// # assert_eq!(State::from_str(section_data).unwrap().into_vec(), vec![
/// Event::SectionHeader(section_header),
/// Event::Newline(Cow::Borrowed("\n".into())),
/// Event::SectionKey(section::Key(Cow::Borrowed("file".into()))),
/// Event::KeyValueSeparator,
/// Event::ValueNotDone(Cow::Borrowed("a".into())),
/// Event::Newline(Cow::Borrowed("\n".into())),
/// Event::ValueDone(Cow::Borrowed("    c".into())),
/// # ]);
