### Repository Clone

* **git-transport** _(shallow - for completeness and because it's still fresh)_
 * [ ] a way to support shallow lines during V1 handshake (doesnt' seem to happen in V2 at all)
 * [ ] shallow support for V2
* **git-odb**
  * [ ] alternate DB
  * [ ] multi-odb 
* **git-ref**
  * [ ] create ref pointing to ID
      * _assure to keep the path towards symbolic refs open, and allow specifying if these should be followed or not_
* **git-repository**
  * [ ] instance for a valid looking repository
    * [ ] support shallow repos/references
  * [ ] create-update refs as received from clone/git-receive-pack
* **gix clone**
  * [ ] try initializing repo on output path - if so, use that to learn about pack location and place new pack there, allow Repo to create refs somehow.
    * _probably this is done using the repository itself, which steers the whole process and injects it's own delegates.
  * [ ] otherwise create the scaffolding needed for a new repository, probably based on `init` implementation
* **receive pack**
  * [ ] resolve thin pack with Bundle
* **git-repository**
  * [ ] clone from https remote
  
### FSCK an entire repository

* **multi-db** (incorporate object lookup for loose objects and packs)
  * [ ] single threaded
  * [ ] optional object cache
  * [ ] fs-check - verify all object content of a git repository
  
### Other

To be picked in any orderâ€¦.

* **prodash**
  * [ ] finish transitioning to futures-lite to get rid of futures-util dependency to reduce compile times
* **criner**
  * [x] upgrade to prodash 9.0
  * [ ] switch to `isahc`
    seems to allow async-reading of bodies, allowing to get rid of reqwest and tokio. Redirect is configurable.
