## v0.6.0 (2020-12-16)

Maintenance release without any new features.

These are created to account for breaking changes within the dependency graph of
`gitoxide` crates. Due to some blunders in the past the version on crates.io
could not be installed anymore.
This was eventually fixed with new minor releases across the ecosystem.

Finally, yet another breaking change due to the introduction of the `git-hash`
crate to break a dependency cycle between `git-object` and `git-features` caused
yet another maintenance release.
